# week-1-semantic-refractor-challenge

# Description of project
For the first week of bootcamp, the assignment I was set was a semantice refractor challenge. Being provided with broken code, I changed the code to follow logical semantic flow, ensured all links on the website worked and followed best practive for class/id naming conventions and met all criteria for the week 1 challenge. Please see Depolyed application link below for the complete working website.
